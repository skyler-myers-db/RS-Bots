# RuneScape Bots

A compilation of [bots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot) for different skills for the [MMORPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) [RuneScape](https://play.runescape.com/). Compatible with both [RS3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1343400/RuneScape/) and [OSRS](https://oldschool.runescape.com/). Will be adding more skills and sectors as time goes on as well as [refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) the old ones. This project uses the [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) [robotJS](http://robotjs.io/) [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) for the [AI](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html) taking over control of the game.
